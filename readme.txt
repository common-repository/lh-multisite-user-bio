Allow users in a multisite to have different biographies or descriptions on the different sites in the network

== Description ==

I wrote this plugin as I have a number of different sites in a multisite network for which I am an author, when templates would display my biography it would often be completely irrelevant to the topic that the site was about. As such I needed different biographies on each different site on the network.

This plugin easily an intuitively enables that functionality.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the entire `lh-multisite-user-bio` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Navigate to Users->Your Profile and set your site specific biographical info.
